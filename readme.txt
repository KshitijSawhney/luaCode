The objective of this prototype was to try to seperate turtle code into files and execute them remotely.
This didnt work.

Remarks:
    -going to go back to using a single "basecode" file to replace startup

For future iterations:
    -identify specific turtles by ID,
    -set up a master computer to hand out instructions.

nice-to-haves:
    -ability to deploy turtles remotely,
    -using mulitple turtles instead of just 1,
    -automatic stripmining
